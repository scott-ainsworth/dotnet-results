# dotnet-results

An experimental error return and propagation type loosely based on Rust's std::result and
F# Results.

## Introduction

without resorting to `try...catch` blocks.  It is loosely modeled on similar libraries from
[Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/) and
[F#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/results).
